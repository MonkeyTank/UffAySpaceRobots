The year 2135: Planet Earth is facing its demise, after a global war has left it a wasteland. A lucky few find shelter underground... in bunkers, subway stations and caves. Everyone else is doomed to endure the full force of the elements. Sandstorms, tornados and floods, just to name a few.\nYou finally got the door open. As you walk through it, you realize that this ship that you have been calling your home for several months is actually a lot larger than you had anticipated. The machinery noises getting louder indicates that you are actually nearing the power supply. You cannot shake the feeling that you are being watched, but that is probably just due to the fact that you know you are not supposed to be here. Wondering what you might find next, you start looking around the room.
