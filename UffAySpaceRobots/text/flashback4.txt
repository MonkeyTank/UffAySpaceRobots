As soon as you have entered the code for this door, you hear an alarm going off. Your heart skips a beat as the floor opens and reveals a cellar filled with people. They are bound and gagged, but you recognize your family and neighbors. Their faces light up as they see you looking down, but before you can get any words out their expressions change to horror. You turn around, and the last thing you see is the wrong end of a laser gun and flash of light.
